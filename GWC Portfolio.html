<!--    <h4>Hello world! I'm Shormie and a Girls Who Code SIP participant at Adobe. The SIP was my first coding class, but not my first coding experience. I've learned some languages prior to the program, such as HTML, CSS, and Python, just to experiment with coding, but I've never put my coding skills to use. My experience with Girls Who Code has made me more confident in my coding abilities and excited to do more with my skills. I especially look forward to combining my interest in English with computer science. Here's a preview of the projects I worked on this summer: </h4> -->
    
  
<!-- Jukebox Proj -->
  <p>
    This is the Jukebox Project I worked with my fellow SIP members. For this project we created a playlist based on the user's mood using Scratch.

<!-- Obamicon Proj -->
  <p>
    This is the Obamicon Project. My partner and I created a version of Obama's famous 2008 campaign posters using Python, but instead of using a photo of President Obama, we used a photo of Malala.
